# React | Webpack

* Start writing a `*.jsx` code within `src/` folder.
* To create a bundle file in `build/` folder run `$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -d` in Terminal.
* To watch result open the `index.html` file in browser.
* To make Webpack watch changes run `$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -d --watch`.
* To make a production bundle run `$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -p`.
* Sake of simplicity you can run dev mode or build production using npm scripts, defined in "scripts" inside `package.json` with `$ npm run dev` and `$ npm run build` respectively.
